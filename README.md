## Design Highlights

- **Vibrant Background:**

- **Interactive Search:**
  - Large, rounded, and shadowed search bar for city lookup.

## How Data is Fetched

- **WeatherAPI Integration:**
  - Uses [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) for real-time weather data.
  - Fetches both current weather and hourly forecast for the searched city.
- **API Call Example:**
  ```js
  const response = await axios.get(
    `http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q=CityName&days=1&aqi=no&alerts=no`
  );
  ```
- **Environment Variables:**
  - The API key is stored in a `.env` file as `VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY` for security.
- **Data Usage:**
  - Displays temperature, condition, icon, humidity, cloud cover, "feels like", rain chance, and a full hourly forecast table.
